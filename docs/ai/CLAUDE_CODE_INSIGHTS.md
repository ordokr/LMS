## Instructions for Claude

This document contains code insights for the LMS Integration Project. Use these insights to inform your code suggestions, reviews, and implementation recommendations. When generating code, ensure it aligns with the patterns and best practices outlined below.

## Common Code Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Implementation Guidance |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Model Definition | Each model file (Course, Module, Assignment, etc.) defines structs with `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` fields, leveraging `serde` for serialization/deserialization. | Centralize common fields like `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` into a base trait or struct to reduce duplication. |
| Option<String> for dates | Dates like `start_date`, `end_date`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` are represented as `Option<String>`. This allows for null values, but might lead to inconsistent date formats. | Use a dedicated date/time library like `chrono` and consider a custom serialization/deserialization implementation to enforce a consistent date format and handle potential parsing errors more explicitly.  Consider `Option<DateTime<Utc>>` |

## Code Quality Standards

When generating or reviewing code, address these quality issues:

### Code Duplication

- **Impact:** Increased maintenance cost, potential for inconsistencies when updating models.
- **Required Fix:** Refactor the code to eliminate duplicated struct definitions, especially the redundant Course, Module, Assignment, and Submission definitions in each model file. Extract these definitions into a central module.

### Lack of input validation

- **Impact:** Data integrity issues, potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Required Fix:** Implement input validation for all model fields, especially for user-provided data. Use libraries like `validator` for this purpose.

## Project-Specific Best Practices

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) | Avoiding code duplication makes code easier to maintain and reduces the risk of inconsistencies. |
| Separation of Concerns | Dividing the application into distinct modules (e.g., models, API handlers, UI components) makes the code more organized and maintainable. |

## Implementation Standards

Follow these standards to maintain consistency:

- **Date/Time Handling**: Use a consistent `DateTime` type from the `chrono` crate and implement custom serialization/deserialization if needed.

## Performance Considerations

| Area | Optimization | Expected Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Database Queries | Implement efficient database querying strategies (e.g., using indexes, avoiding N+1 queries). | Improved response times for API endpoints. |
| Data Serialization/Deserialization | Benchmark different serialization/deserialization libraries and choose the most efficient one for the project. | Reduced latency for data transfer between the application and the database or client. |

## Priority Implementation Actions

When suggesting implementation approaches, prioritize these actions:

1. `priority:1` Refactor model definitions to eliminate code duplication.
2. `priority:2` Implement API endpoints for core functionalities.
3. `priority:3` Standardize date/time handling using chrono crate.

## Code Generation Examples

When generating code, follow these patterns:

### Error Handling Example

```rust
  // GOOD: Consistent error handling with proper types
  pub fn process_data(input: &str) -> Result<Data, AppError> {
      // Validate input
      if input.is_empty() {
          return Err(AppError::ValidationError("Input cannot be empty".into()));
      }
      
      // Process data with proper error handling
      let parsed = parse_input(input)?;
      let processed = transform_data(parsed)?;
      
      Ok(processed)
  }
  ```

### API Pattern Example

```rust
  // GOOD: Consistent API structure
  #[tauri::command]
  pub async fn fetch_courses(state: State<'_, AppState>) -> Result<Vec<Course>, AppError> {
      // Get database connection from state
      let mut conn = state.db.acquire().await?;
      
      // Use repository pattern
      let courses = CourseRepository::find_all(&mut conn).await?;
      
      // Return standardized response
      Ok(courses)
  }
  ```
