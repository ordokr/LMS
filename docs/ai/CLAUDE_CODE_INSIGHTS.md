## Instructions for Claude

This document contains code insights for the LMS Integration Project. Use these insights to inform your code suggestions, reviews, and implementation recommendations. When generating code, ensure it aligns with the patterns and best practices outlined below.

## Common Code Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Implementation Guidance |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Adapter Pattern | Anticipated need to adapt the interface of the external LMS API to the internal application's domain models and services. | Implement dedicated Adapter classes for each integrated LMS functionality to isolate external dependencies and simplify replacements or updates. |
| Repository Pattern | Expected need for abstracting data access logic, potentially interacting with both local storage and the LMS API. | Use Repositories to centralize data access logic, providing a clean interface for services and improving testability. |
| Service Layer | Business logic related to LMS integration (e.g., user synchronization, course enrollment) will likely require orchestration. | Implement a dedicated Service Layer to encapsulate business logic, orchestrate calls to repositories and adapters, and manage transactions. |

## Code Quality Standards

When generating or reviewing code, address these quality issues:

### Lack of Unit/Integration Tests

- **Impact:** Inability to verify integration logic, increased risk of regressions, difficult refactoring.
- **Required Fix:** Establish a testing strategy early. Write unit tests for services/logic and integration tests for interactions with the LMS API (using mocks/stubs or a dedicated test environment).

### Missing Logging and Monitoring

- **Impact:** Difficulty diagnosing integration failures, lack of visibility into data synchronization processes.
- **Required Fix:** Implement structured logging throughout the integration module. Set up monitoring dashboards to track API call success/failure rates, latency, and data flow.

### Hardcoded Sensitive Information

- **Impact:** Security vulnerabilities, difficult credential rotation.
- **Required Fix:** Store API keys, secrets, and other sensitive data securely using a secrets management solution (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) and load them via configuration.

## Project-Specific Best Practices

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| SOLID Principles | Ensures code is maintainable, extensible, and testable. Particularly important for adapters and services handling complex integration logic. |
| Dependency Injection | Promotes loose coupling and testability by managing object dependencies externally. |
| Asynchronous Processing | For long-running integration tasks (e.g., large data syncs), use background jobs or message queues to avoid blocking main application threads and improve responsiveness. |
| Code Reviews | Essential for maintaining code quality, sharing knowledge, and catching potential issues early. |
| Establish Coding Standards | Ensures consistency in naming, formatting, and structure, improving readability and maintainability. Use linters and formatters. |

## Implementation Standards

Follow these standards to maintain consistency:

- **Error Handling Strategy**: Define a consistent approach for error handling, logging, and user feedback (if applicable) for all integration points.
- **Data Mapping**: Use a standardized mapping library (e.g., AutoMapper, MapStruct) or clear mapping functions/classes. Document the mapping rules.
- **API Client Implementation**: Create a centralized, reusable HTTP client wrapper or service specifically for LMS API interactions, standardizing request/response handling, authentication, and error parsing.

## Performance Considerations

| Area | Optimization | Expected Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| LMS API Calls | Implement caching for frequently accessed, rarely changing LMS data (e.g., course lists, user profiles) to reduce redundant API calls. | Reduced latency, lower API usage costs, less load on the external LMS. |
| Data Synchronization | Utilize pagination and batch processing when fetching or pushing large datasets to/from the LMS. Consider delta/incremental syncs instead of full syncs where possible. | Improved performance, reduced memory consumption, lower risk of timeouts. |
| Asynchronous Operations | Identify I/O-bound operations (API calls, database access) and use asynchronous patterns (async/await, Futures, Promises) to avoid blocking threads. | Increased throughput and application responsiveness. |

## Priority Implementation Actions

When suggesting implementation approaches, prioritize these actions:

1. `priority:1` Define and document the core architecture for the integration module (modularity, key components like Adapters, Services, Repositories).
2. `priority:2` Establish coding standards, linting rules, and formatting guidelines for the project.
3. `priority:3` Set up foundational infrastructure: CI/CD pipeline, logging framework, configuration management, and secrets management.
4. `priority:4` Define the primary data models for entities shared between the application and the LMS (e.g., User, Course, Enrollment).
5. `priority:5` Prototype the connection and authentication mechanism with the target LMS API.

## Code Generation Examples

When generating code, follow these patterns:

### Error Handling Example

```rust
  // GOOD: Consistent error handling with proper types
  pub fn process_data(input: &str) -> Result<Data, AppError> {
      // Validate input
      if input.is_empty() {
          return Err(AppError::ValidationError("Input cannot be empty".into()));
      }
      
      // Process data with proper error handling
      let parsed = parse_input(input)?;
      let processed = transform_data(parsed)?;
      
      Ok(processed)
  }
  ```

### API Pattern Example

```rust
  // GOOD: Consistent API structure
  #[tauri::command]
  pub async fn fetch_courses(state: State<'_, AppState>) -> Result<Vec<Course>, AppError> {
      // Get database connection from state
      let mut conn = state.db.acquire().await?;
      
      // Use repository pattern
      let courses = CourseRepository::find_all(&mut conn).await?;
      
      // Return standardized response
      Ok(courses)
  }
  ```
