## Code Performance Hotspots

The following files have the highest complexity scores, which may indicate performance concerns:

| File | Complexity Score | Lines of Code | Complexity/LOC |
|------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|

## Runtime Performance Estimates

### API Endpoint Estimated Performance

| Endpoint | Method | Estimated Response Time | Complexity |
|----------|--------|-------------------------|------------|

## Performance Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations for improving performance:

- **Refactor High Complexity Code**: 600 files have high complexity scores. Consider breaking these down into smaller, more manageable functions.

- **Implement Caching**: Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

- **Bundle and Minify Frontend Assets**: Ensure JavaScript and CSS files are properly bundled and minified for production.

- **Pagination for Large Data Sets**: Implement pagination for any API endpoints that return large data sets.
