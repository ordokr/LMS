## Integration Strategy

The LMS project integrates Canvas LMS and Discourse forum functionality into a unified Rust/Tauri/Leptos application. The integration follows these principles:

- **Unified Data Model**: Core entities from both systems are mapped to a common data model
- **Consistent UI**: A unified UI experience across all functionality
- **Offline-First**: All features work offline with synchronization when online
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and resource efficiency
- **Security**: Comprehensive security model across all integrated components

## Integration Components
- **Canvas Course Management**: Integrates Canvas with LMS. Status: In Progress
- **Discourse Forums**: Integrates Discourse with LMS. Status: Planned
- **Blockchain Certification**: Integrates Native with LMS. Status: In Progress
