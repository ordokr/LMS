# Migration Plan: Discourse and Canvas to New System

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the core functionalities of Discourse and Canvas LMS to a new, unified system built on Rust, Tauri, and Leptos. The migration will be phased, focusing on the most critical features first to ensure a smooth transition.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Incremental Migration:** We will avoid a "big bang" migration. Instead, we will migrate features incrementally, testing each thoroughly before moving to the next.
2.  **Feature Parity:** The goal is to replicate the core functionality of both platforms in the new system. We will prioritize the most used features.
3.  **Data Integrity:** Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data during the migration is paramount. We will validate data after each migration phase.
4.  **User Experience:** We will strive to minimize disruption for users during the migration process and ensure that the new system provides a seamless user experience.
5. **Offline first:** We will make sure the new system provides full offline capabilities.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Core User and Authentication System

*   **Objective:** Establish the fundamental user management and authentication framework in the new system.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Migrate user models (users, roles, permissions) from both platforms to the unified user model in the new system.
    *   Implement authentication mechanisms (login, logout, session management, password management).
    *   Implement authorization checks and role-based access control.
    *   Set up user profile management (profile viewing, editing).
    *   Test user creation, authentication, and authorization thoroughly.
    * **Offline Support**: Ensure full offline support for user login and data synchronization.

### Phase 2: Core Course and Category Management

*   **Objective:** Replicate the basic course and category structure of Canvas and Discourse.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Migrate course models and data from Canvas.
    *   Migrate category models and data from Discourse.
    *   Implement course creation, editing, and deletion.
    *   Implement category creation, editing, and deletion.
    *   Establish relationships between courses and categories.
    *   Test course and category management features.
    * **Offline Support**: Provide course and category creation and edition offline.

### Phase 3: Forum and Discussion Functionality

*   **Objective:** Recreate the core forum and discussion features of Discourse.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Migrate topic models and data.
    *   Migrate post models and data.
    *   Implement topic creation, editing, and deletion.
    *   Implement post creation, editing, and deletion.
    *   Implement topic viewing and participation features.
    *   Test the forum and discussion functionality thoroughly.
    * **Offline Support:** Allow users to create posts and topics offline.

### Phase 4: Canvas Module and Assignment Integration

*   **Objective:** Integrate Canvas module and assignment structures into the unified system.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Migrate module models and data.
    *   Migrate assignment models and data.
    *   Implement module management (creation, editing, deletion).
    *   Implement assignment management (creation, editing, submission, grading).
    *   Establish relationships between modules, assignments, and courses.
    *   Test the Canvas-specific module and assignment integration.
    * **Offline Support:** Create and edit modules and assignments offline.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features and Integrations

*   **Objective:** Implement advanced features and integrate with external systems.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement search functionality.
    *   Implement notification systems.
    *   Implement advanced reporting and analytics.
    *   Integrate with external systems if needed.
    *   Thoroughly test all advanced features.
    *   **Offline Support**: Provide support for the most important advanced functionalities offline.

### Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

* **Objective:** Prepare the new platform for release.
* **Tasks**:
    * Perform extensive integration and E2E tests.
    * Perform user acceptance tests with a focus group.
    * Deploy the new platform.
    * **Offline Support:** Check all offline capabilities.

## Data Migration Strategy

*   **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL):** We will use an ETL process to migrate data from the existing systems to the new system.
*   **Data Validation:** Data will be validated after each migration step to ensure accuracy.
* **Data Synchronization:** During the transition we will provide a way to keep the data synchronized between both systems.

## Risk Management

*   **Data Loss:** To mitigate the risk of data loss, we will back up all data before each migration step.
*   **Downtime:** We will plan for and communicate expected downtime with users.
* **Rollback plan:** If we encounter major issues after deployment, we will implement a rollback plan.

## Communication

*   **Regular Updates:** We will communicate progress to stakeholders regularly.
*   **User Announcements:** Users will be informed of upcoming changes and any potential disruptions.

This migration plan will be updated and adapted as we make progress through each phase.
