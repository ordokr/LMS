## 3. Reporting and Review

- Weekly progress reports against baselines
- Bi-weekly KPI review meetings
- Monthly baseline review and adjustment if necessary
- Quarterly executive review

## 4. Baseline Change Management

Any changes to the established baseline must follow this process:
1. Change request documented with justification
2. Impact analysis on scope, schedule, and resources
3. Review and approval by project stakeholders
4. Update of baseline documents
5. Communication to all team members

Changes will be tracked in the project change log.
