## Current Status

The Ordo LMS application has made significant progress in the backend implementation, with the core infrastructure, authentication system, and quiz module now complete. The API layer is fully implemented, providing a comprehensive set of endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

We have successfully implemented:
- A complete quiz repository with CRUD operations for quizzes, questions, and answers
- Quiz session management for tracking user attempts and progress
- Quiz analytics for tracking user performance
- A comprehensive API layer with standardized error handling
- Integration with the main application router

The next major focus will be on testing the API endpoints to ensure they work as expected, followed by implementing the frontend UI components to create a usable application. This will be followed by the standalone quiz functionality, build system configuration, and comprehensive testing.

## Conclusion

The critical path for development has been well-established, and the core components needed for a buildable and runnable application are in place. The remaining work is focused on creating a user-friendly interface and ensuring the application is properly packaged and tested.
