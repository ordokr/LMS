| Feature | Description | Criticality |
|---------|-------------|------------|

## Recommendations

 1. The application is well-suited for offline-first implementation with minimal changes.
 2. Consider using IndexedDB or SQLite for client-side data storage.
 3. Implement a background sync mechanism using Service Workers.
 4. Add a queue system for operations performed while offline.
