## Storage Architecture

Ordo uses a hybrid storage approach combining SQLite and Redb. For more details, see the [Database Architecture](../architecture/database.md) document.

## Synchronization Engine

The synchronization engine handles data synchronization between local and remote databases. For more details, see the [Synchronization Architecture](../architecture/synchronization.md) and [Sync Engine Implementation](sync_engine_implementation.md) documents.

## API Implementation

Ordo's API is built using Axum with Tower middleware for a modular, composable approach to handling HTTP requests. For more details, see the [API Overview](../api/overview.md) and [Tower Middleware Implementation](implementation_details.md#tower-middleware-implementation) documents.

## Background Job System

Ordo uses a background job system for handling asynchronous tasks. For more details, see the [Background Job System](background_job_system.md) document.

## Blockchain Integration

Ordo integrates blockchain technology for academic certification. For more details, see the [Blockchain Integration](blockchain_integration.md) document.

## Serialization Implementation

Ordo uses serde and bincode for efficient, type-safe serialization and deserialization of data. This is crucial for the offline-first architecture, sync operations, and storage efficiency. For more details, see the [Serialization Implementation](serialization_implementation.md) document.

## Logging Implementation

Ordo implements structured, async-friendly logging using tracing and tracing-subscriber. This approach provides context-aware logs that work well with Ordo's async architecture and modular design. For more details, see the [Logging Implementation](logging_implementation.md) document.

## Environment Variables

Ordo uses dotenvy for secure, flexible environment variable management. This approach keeps sensitive configuration out of the codebase while supporting multiple environments and deployment scenarios. For more details, see the [Environment Variables](environment_variables.md) document.

## Vector Clock Optimization

Ordo uses vector clocks for conflict resolution in distributed systems. For more details, see the [Vector Clock Optimization](vector_clock_optimization.md) document.
