## Recommendations

 1. The application requires moderate changes to support offline-first functionality.
 2. Implement conflict resolution strategies (e.g., timestamp-based or version-based) for offline data synchronization.
 3. Consider using IndexedDB or SQLite for client-side data storage.
 4. Implement a background sync mechanism using Service Workers.
 5. Add a queue system for operations performed while offline.
