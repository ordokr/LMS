# Visualizations

This directory contains visualizations generated by the Unified Analyzer. These visualizations provide interactive and graphical representations of various aspects of the codebase.

## Available Visualizations

- [API Map](api_map/api_map.html) - A visualization of the API endpoints and their relationships
- [Component Tree](component_tree/component_tree.html) - A visualization of the component hierarchy and dependencies
- [Database Schema](db_schema/db_schema.html) - A visualization of the database schema and relationships
- [Source Database Schema](source_db_schema/source_db_schema.html) - A visualization of the database schema extracted from Canvas and Discourse source code
- [Migration Roadmap](migration_roadmap/migration_roadmap.html) - A visualization of the migration roadmap

## How to Use

Each visualization is available in multiple formats:

- **HTML** - Interactive visualizations that can be viewed in a web browser
- **Markdown** - Static visualizations that can be viewed in a Markdown viewer
- **JSON** - Raw data that can be used for further processing (only available for some visualizations)

## Updating Visualizations

These visualizations are automatically generated by the Unified Analyzer. To update them, run the analyzer with the appropriate command:

```bash
# Generate all visualizations
cargo run --bin unified-analyzer -- viz

# Generate specific visualizations
cargo run --bin unified-analyzer -- api-map
cargo run --bin unified-analyzer -- component-tree
cargo run --bin unified-analyzer -- db-schema
cargo run --bin unified-analyzer -- source-db-schema
cargo run --bin unified-analyzer -- roadmap
```

Alternatively, you can use the standalone visualization generators:

```bash
# Generate source database schema visualization
cargo run --bin db_schema_viz
```

## Customizing Visualizations

The visualizations are generated using templates located in the `src/generators` directory. You can customize these templates to change the appearance and behavior of the visualizations.
