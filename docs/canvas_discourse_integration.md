# Canvas-Discourse Integration Reference

_Generated on: 2025-04-06_

## Overview

This document serves as the central reference for integrating Canvas LMS with Discourse forums.
It provides key information on model mappings, integration architecture, and implementation recommendations.

## Model Mapping

# Canvas-Discourse Integration Points

## Overview

This document describes the key integration points between Canvas LMS and Discourse forum systems.

## Integration Mapping

### Course to Category Mapping

Canvas courses can be mapped to Discourse categories:

| Canvas | Discourse | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Course | Category | One-to-one mapping |
| Course Sections | Sub-categories | Optional |

### Discussion Topic Mapping

Canvas discussion topics can be synchronized with Discourse topics:

| Canvas | Discourse | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Discussion Topic | Topic | One-to-one mapping |
| Discussion Entry | Post | One-to-one mapping |
| Discussion Reply | Reply | One-to-one mapping |

## Integration Strategies

1. **API-based integration**: Use REST APIs on both systems
2. **Event-driven integration**: Use webhooks and event subscribers
3. **Database-level integration**: Direct database integration (not recommended)

## Authentication Flow

For SSO between Canvas and Discourse:

1. Canvas authenticates the user
2. Canvas generates a signed payload with user information
3. User is redirected to Discourse with the payload
4. Discourse verifies the payload and creates/logs in the user


## Architecture

# Integration Architecture Blueprint

## Overview

This document describes the recommended architecture for integrating Canvas LMS with Discourse forums.

## Integration Components

1. **API Adapters**: Connect to both systems via their APIs
2. **Event Listeners**: Listen for changes in either system
3. **Sync Service**: Maintain data consistency between systems
4. **Mapping Service**: Handle entity relationships between systems
5. **Authentication Bridge**: Enable SSO between systems


## Implementation Recommendations

Based on the integration architecture and requirements, we recommend:

1. **API-based Integration**: Use REST APIs on both systems as the primary integration method
   - Canvas API for course and assignment data
   - Discourse API for forum interaction

2. **Single Sign-On**: Implement SSO between Canvas and Discourse 
   - Use JWT or OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
   - Maintain user role synchronization

3. **Synchronization Service**: Create a middle-tier service that:
   - Maps Canvas courses to Discourse categories
   - Synchronizes discussion topics between systems
   - Handles user permission mapping

4. **Error Handling & Resilience**: 
   - Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Add logging for synchronization failures
   - Design for eventual consistency

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit test each integration point independently
2. Integration tests for end-to-end flows
3. Load testing to ensure synchronization performance
4. Security testing for authentication flows

## Next Steps

1. Complete detailed technical design document
2. Set up development environment with Canvas and Discourse instances
3. Implement authentication integration (SSO)
4. Develop course-to-category synchronization
5. Implement discussion topic synchronization
