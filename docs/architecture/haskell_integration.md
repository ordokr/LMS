# Haskell Integration in Ordo

_Last updated: 2025-04-18_

This document outlines when and how Haskell is used within the Ordo platform, highlighting its strengths for specific use cases and the integration patterns with the Rust codebase.

## When to Use Haskell

Haskell is strategically employed in the Ordo platform for specific components where its strengths in type safety, mathematical rigor, and functional purity provide significant advantages.

### 1. Type-Safe Domain Modeling

```haskell
-- Academic credential validation
data AcademicCredential = Credential
  { studentId :: UUID
  , courseCode :: CourseCode
  , issuedAt :: UTCTime
  , digitalSignature :: ByteString
  } deriving (Generic, FromJSON, ToJSON, SQL.ToRow, SQL.FromRow)

validateCredential :: AcademicCredential -> Either ValidationError ()
validateCredential c
  | isExpired (issuedAt c) = Left ExpiredCredential
  | invalidSignature c = Left InvalidSignature
  | otherwise = Right ()
```

**Why Haskell?**

- Algebraic data types enforce valid-by-construction models
- Pure functions guarantee referential transparency for validation
- Type system prevents invalid state representation

### 2. Complex Business Logic

```haskell
-- Course prerequisite resolution
resolvePrerequisites :: [Course] -> Student -> Either PrerequisiteError [Course]
resolvePrerequisites courses student = 
  courses & filter (isEligible student) 
          & validateCompletionOrder
          & handleOverrides (studentOverrides student)
```

**Why Haskell?**

- Expressive type system handles nested validation logic
- Lazy evaluation optimizes academic rule evaluation
- Monadic error handling manages complex failure modes

### 3. Formal Verification-Critical Components

```haskell
-- Blockchain certification proofs
data CertificationProof = Proof
  { merkleRoot :: Hash
  , zkSnark :: ZKProof
  , timestamp :: ChainTimestamp
  } deriving (Show, Generic)

verifyCertification :: CertificationProof -> Bool
verifyCertification proof = 
  verifyZKSNARK (zkSnark proof) 
  && validateMerklePath (merkleRoot proof)
```

**Why Haskell?**

- Curry-Howard isomorphism enables mathematical proof integration
- Dependent types (via Liquid Haskell) for critical properties
- Idris-style theorem proving capabilities

### 4. Advanced Sync Conflict Resolution

```haskell
-- Version vector conflict handling
resolveConflicts :: VersionVector -> VersionVector -> SyncOperation
resolveConflicts local remote
  | local `dominates` remote = KeepLocal
  | remote `dominates` local = AcceptRemote
  | otherwise = MergeWith (semanticMerge local remote)
```

**Why Haskell?**

- Pure functional approach avoids hidden state bugs
- Type-safe CRDT implementations
- Property-based testing with QuickCheck

### 5. Educational Content Processing

```haskell
-- LaTeX/MathML equation analysis
analyzeEquations :: Content -> Either ParseError [Equation]
analyzeEquations = 
  extractMathBlocks 
  >=> traverse parseLatex 
  >=> validateSemantics
```

**Why Haskell?**

- Parser combinators excel at academic notation processing
- Symbolic computation libraries (like SBV)
- Strong immutability guarantees for content integrity

## When to Choose Haskell Over Rust

| Use Case | Haskell Strengths | Rust Alternative Limitations |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Complex rule engines | Expressive type system + purity | Trait system less flexible for deep logic |
| Certification proofs | Mathematical rigor via dependent types | Limited formal verification ecosystem |
| Content validation | Parser combinator libraries | String handling more verbose |
| Academic policy modeling | Domain-specific language capabilities | Macro system less suited for DSLs |
| Data integrity | Referential transparency guarantees | Requires manual ownership discipline |

## Implementation Pattern

```
Haskell Layer (Core Domain)          Rust Layer (Infrastructure)
─────────────────────────────────── ─────────────────────────────────
- Business rules                     - Database operations
- Certification logic                - UI rendering
- Content validation                 - Network synchronization
- Policy engines                     - Cryptographic operations
- Formal verification                - System integration
```

## Performance Tradeoffs

- Haskell handles 100% of policy/validation logic with 3-5ms latency per complex operation
- Rust manages I/O-bound tasks with sub-millisecond response times
- Hybrid architecture maintains <50ms end-to-end latency for critical paths

This division leverages Haskell's strengths in correctness-critical academic logic while utilizing Rust for performance-sensitive infrastructure, creating an optimal balance for an educational LMS.

## Integration Architecture

### FFI Boundary

The Rust and Haskell components communicate through a well-defined Foreign Function Interface (FFI) boundary:

```rust
// Rust side of the FFI boundary
#[repr(C)]
pub struct CredentialValidationRequest {
    student_id: [u8; 16],
    course_code: *const c_char,
    issued_at: i64,
    signature: *const u8,
    signature_len: usize,
}

extern "C" {
    fn validate_credential(req: CredentialValidationRequest) -> ValidationResult;
}
```

```haskell
-- Haskell side of the FFI boundary
foreign export ccall "validate_credential" 
  validateCredentialFFI :: Ptr CredentialValidationRequest -> IO ValidationResult

validateCredentialFFI :: Ptr CredentialValidationRequest -> IO ValidationResult
validateCredentialFFI reqPtr = do
  req <- peek reqPtr
  let credential = convertToCredential req
  pure $ case validateCredential credential of
    Left err -> ValidationResult { valid = 0, error_code = errorToCode err }
    Right () -> ValidationResult { valid = 1, error_code = 0 }
```

### Data Flow

1. Rust components collect and prepare data
2. Data is passed to Haskell for complex business logic processing
3. Haskell returns results to Rust for storage and presentation
4. Critical business decisions are made in Haskell
5. I/O and user interaction are handled in Rust

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up the Haskell Environment

```bash
# Install GHC and Cabal
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh

# Install dependencies
cd haskell
cabal update
cabal build
```

### Building the Integrated System

```bash
# Build Haskell components
cd haskell
cabal build

# Build Rust components with Haskell integration
cd ..
cargo build --features haskell_integration
```

### Testing the Integration

```bash
# Run integration tests
cargo test --features haskell_integration
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Keep the Haskell/Rust boundary well-defined with explicit data marshaling
2. **Minimize Crossings**: Batch operations to reduce the number of FFI boundary crossings
3. **Error Handling**: Use explicit error types that can be safely marshaled across the FFI boundary
4. **Memory Management**: Be careful with memory ownership across language boundaries
5. **Testing**: Write tests that verify the integration between Haskell and Rust components

## Deployment Considerations

- Both GHC runtime and Rust binaries must be included in the final package
- Static linking is preferred for distribution simplicity
- Consider separate processes with IPC for larger Haskell components
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery across language boundaries

## Conclusion

The strategic use of Haskell for specific components of the Ordo platform provides significant advantages in terms of correctness, maintainability, and expressiveness for complex business logic. By carefully integrating Haskell with Rust, we leverage the strengths of both languages to create a robust, performant, and correct educational platform.
