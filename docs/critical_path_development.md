# Ordo LMS Development Critical Path

This document outlines the critical path for developing a buildable and runnable Ordo LMS application with integrated quiz functionality. It provides a comprehensive roadmap of components that need to be implemented to achieve a functional application.

## Overview

The Ordo LMS application is a Rust/Haskell-based learning management system with an integrated forum and a detachable quiz module. The application uses:

- **Backend**: Rust with Axum for API, SQLite for database
- **Frontend**: Leptos for UI components
- **Desktop Application**: Tauri for cross-platform desktop application
- **Quiz Module**: Standalone and integrated quiz functionality

## Critical Path Components

The critical path for development consists of five major components:

1. **Core Infrastructure Setup**: Database, application state, configuration, and error handling
2. **Backend Core Components**: API server, authentication, repositories, and services
3. **Quiz Module Implementation**: Quiz models, storage, session management, and standalone functionality
4. **Frontend Integration**: UI components, state management, and API integration
5. **Build System and Packaging**: Tauri configuration, build scripts, and application bundling

## Implementation Strategy

The recommended implementation strategy is:

1. Start with the database layer
2. Build the API layer
3. Implement the quiz module
4. Add the UI components
5. Configure the build system

This approach ensures that the foundational components are in place before building the user-facing features.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

For a basic runnable version of the Ordo LMS app, focus on:

1. Core database setup
2. Basic authentication
3. Quiz module core functionality
4. Minimal UI
5. Standalone quiz functionality

## Detailed Implementation Plan

See the accompanying checklist document for a detailed, fine-grained implementation plan.
