# System Patterns

## Design Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Used for managing database connections to ensure a single instance is used throughout the application.
- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented for real-time updates in the forum system, where subscribers are notified of new posts or changes.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Utilized for creating instances of different notification services (e.g., email, SMS).

## Architectural Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is divided into microservices such as user management, course management, and forum management to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Event Sourcing**: Used for capturing all changes to the application state as a sequence of events, which can be used to reconstruct the current state or audit historical data.

## Data Patterns
- **CRUD Operations**: Standard Create, Read, Update, Delete operations are implemented for managing data entities like users, courses, and assignments.
- **Data Validation**: Input validation is performed at multiple levels (e.g., API endpoints, database constraints) to ensure data integrity.

## Integration Patterns
- **RESTful APIs**: Used for communication between the Rust backend and external systems like Canvas LMS and Discourse Forums.
- **Webhooks**: Implemented for real-time event handling from external systems, such as new post notifications from Discourse.

## Security Patterns
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens are used for secure authentication and authorization of API requests.
- **HTTPS**: All data transmission is encrypted using HTTPS to protect sensitive information.

## Performance Patterns
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached in memory to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Lazy Loading**: Data is loaded only when needed, reducing initial load times and resource usage.
