# Plan for Creating a Rust-Based Discourse Forum

This document outlines the plan for creating a Rust-based Discourse.org forum-like system that is a component of the LMS app.

## Core Components

1.  **Reactive Forum Core (Leptos)**

    *   `src/core/forum.rs`
    *   This file will contain the core data structures for the forum, such as `ForumConfig`, `Category`, and `TrustSystem`.

2.  **Trust Level System**

    *   `src/core/trust.rs`
    *   This file will contain the `TrustLevel` enum and the logic for calculating trust levels based on user stats.

3.  **Real-time Sync Engine**

    *   `src/sync/mod.rs`
    *   This file will contain the `SyncEngine` struct and the logic for synchronizing changes between the local store and a remote server.

4.  **Plugin System (WASM)**

    *   `plugins/Cargo.toml`
    *   This file will define the dependencies for the forum plugin system.

5.  **Tauri Desktop Integration**

    *   `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
    *   This file will be modified to integrate the forum core into the Tauri application.

6.  **Storage Layer**

    *   `src/storage/mod.rs`
    *   This file will define the `ForumStore` struct and the logic for storing forum data in SQLite and redb.

7.  **Realtime Updates**

    *   `src/realtime/mod.rs`
    *   This file will contain the `websocket_handler` function for handling real-time updates.

8.  **Security Model**

    *   `src/auth/mod.rs`
    *   This file will contain the `AuthGuard` struct and the logic for authenticating users and checking permissions.

9.  **Implementation Validation**

    *   `src/tests/mod.rs`
    *   This file will contain integration tests for the forum system.
