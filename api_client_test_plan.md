# API Client Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for API client components that will be consolidated as part of the codebase cleanup effort. It includes test cases for the unified API client implementation that will replace the redundant implementations.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

Unit tests will verify the behavior of individual components in isolation, using mocks for external dependencies.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify the interaction between components, using real or simulated external services.

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests will verify the behavior of the entire system, using real external services when possible.
