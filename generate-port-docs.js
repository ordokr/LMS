## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for porting Canvas LMS and Discourse forum functionality 
to our integrated LMS application.

## General Approach

1. **Selective Porting**: Not all features from source systems are being ported
2. **Architectural Adaptation**: Adapting to Rust/Tauri/Leptos architecture
3. **Integration First**: Prioritizing integration points over feature completeness
4. **Offline Support**: Adding offline capabilities not present in source systems

## Source System Characteristics

### Canvas LMS
- Ruby on Rails monolith
- Complex model associations
- Deep feature set
- Limited offline capabilities

### Discourse
- Ruby on Rails/Ember.js
- Community-focused
- Extensible plugin system
- Real-time capabilities

## Porting Process

1. **Analysis**: Analyze source code structure and relationships
2. **Model Mapping**: Create equivalent model structures in Rust
3. **API Reimplementation**: Reimplement key API endpoints
4. **Integration Points**: Identify and implement cross-system integrations
5. **Testing**: Verify feature parity and integration

## Port Categories

Different components are being handled in different ways:

| Approach | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Direct Port | Almost 1:1 translation | Basic models, simple controllers |
| Adapted Port | Significant restructuring | Complex controllers, UI components |
| Full Rewrite | Complete reimplementation | Real-time features, offline sync |
| Omitted | Not included in target system | Legacy features, unused components |

## Technology Mapping

| Source Technology | Target Technology |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Ruby on Rails | Axum (Rust) |
| PostgreSQL | SQLite + CRDT |
| Redis | In-memory cache |
| ActionCable | WebSocket server |
| ERB/HAML/Ember | Leptos (Rust WASM) |
| Sidekiq | Background tasks |

## Known Model Conflicts

1. **User Model Conflicts**: Both systems have user models with different fields
   - Resolution: Unified model with fields from both systems
   - Status: Resolved

2. **Discussion/Topic Conflicts**: Similar functionality, different structures
   - Resolution: Created ForumTopic model that accommodates both systems
   - Status: Resolved

3. **Notification Model Conflicts**: Different notification systems
   - Resolution: New unified notification system in development
   - Status: In Progress

4. **Permission Model Conflicts**: Different role-based systems
   - Resolution: Unified permission system based on Canvas roles with Discourse trust levels
   - Status: In Progress

## Next Steps

1. Complete enrollment model integration
2. Finalize notification system unification
3. Implement user preference synchronization
4. Add blockchain verification for academic records

function generateApiMappingDoc(docsDir) {
  const content = `# API Endpoint Mapping

## Overview

This document maps API endpoints from Canvas and Discourse to our integrated LMS application.

## Canvas API Endpoints

| Canvas Endpoint | Target Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| /api/v1/courses | /api/courses | ‚úÖ Complete | Added offline support |
| /api/v1/courses/:id/assignments | /api/courses/:id/assignments | ‚úÖ Complete | Support for offline creation |
| /api/v1/courses/:id/discussion_topics | /api/courses/:id/forums | ‚úÖ Complete | Integrated with forum system |
| /api/v1/courses/:id/users | /api/courses/:id/users | ‚úÖ Complete | Role-based filtering |
| /api/v1/users/:id/profile | /api/users/:id | ‚úÖ Complete | Unified with forum profile |

## Discourse API Endpoints

| Discourse Endpoint | Target Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|--------------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| /categories.json | /api/forums/categories | ‚úÖ Complete | Course integration |
| /t/:slug/:id.json | /api/forums/topics/:id | ‚úÖ Complete | Course integration |
| /posts/:id.json | /api/forums/posts/:id | ‚úÖ Complete | Unified with discussions |
| /users/:username.json | /api/users/:id | ‚úÖ Complete | Unified with user profile |

## Authentication Integration

| Source System | Authentication Method | Integration | Status |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------|--------|
| Canvas | OAuth 2.0 | JWT token adapter | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Discourse | SSO/OAuth | JWT token adapter | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Target LMS | JWT tokens | Native implementation | ‚úÖ Complete |

## API Integration Patterns

1. **Direct Mapping**: 1:1 endpoint mapping with similar functionality
2. **Aggregated Endpoints**: Combining data from multiple source endpoints
3. **Enhanced Endpoints**: Source endpoints with added functionality
4. **New Endpoints**: Entirely new endpoints for integration features

## Known API Conflicts

1. **Authentication Conflicts**: Different auth mechanisms across systems
   - Resolution: Unified JWT-based authentication
   - Status: Resolved

2. **Discussion/Topics API Overlap**: Similar APIs with different structures
   - Resolution: Unified API with adapters for both systems
   - Status: Resolved

3. **User API Differences**: Different user information models
   - Resolution: Combined user API with fields from both systems
   - Status: Resolved

## Next Steps

1. Complete offline sync API endpoints
2. Add file upload/download endpoints with offline support
3. Implement blockchain verification endpoints
4. Add realtime notification endpoints
