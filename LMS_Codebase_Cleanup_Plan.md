## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Safeguards
1. **Never delete code without verification**: Always verify functionality before removing code
2. **Maintain test coverage**: Ensure test coverage remains the same or improves
3. **Incremental changes**: Make small, incremental changes that can be easily verified
4. **Feature flags**: Use feature flags to gradually roll out changes
5. **Backward compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Refactoring Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class should have only one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Analyzer Utilization
1. **Extend existing analyzers**: Modify the unified-analyzer to detect specific redundancy patterns
2. **Custom linting rules**: Create custom rules for detecting redundant implementations
3. **Automated metrics**: Configure analyzers to generate metrics for tracking progress
4. **Integration with CI/CD**: Ensure analyzers run automatically in the CI pipeline
5. **Threshold enforcement**: Set up quality gates based on analyzer metrics

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Architecture documentation**: Document the overall architecture and design decisions
2. **API documentation**: Document all public APIs with examples
3. **Migration guides**: Provide guides for migrating from old to new patterns
4. **Code comments**: Add meaningful comments for complex logic
