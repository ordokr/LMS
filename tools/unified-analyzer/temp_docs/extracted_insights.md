# Extracted Insights from AI-Related Documentation

This document contains valuable insights extracted from AI/Gemini-related documentation that should be preserved in the unified analyzer's documentation.

## Project Structure

The project structure is a key constant that should be preserved:

```

## Technology Stack

The technology stack is another constant that should be preserved:

- **Frontend**: Leptos, Tauri
- **Backend**: Rust, Haskell
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLx
- **Search**: MeiliSearch
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Blockchain**: Custom Rust implementation

## Architecture Principles

The following architecture principles should be preserved:

- Clean Architecture
- SOLID
- Offline-first

## Design Patterns

The following design patterns should be preserved:

- CQRS
- Event Sourcing
- Repository Pattern

## Common Code Patterns

The following common code patterns were identified and should be preserved:

1. **Repository Pattern**: Data access through repository interfaces
2. **Type Safety**: Ensures runtime stability
3. **Error Handling**: Should be standardized across the codebase

## Implementation Recommendations

The following implementation recommendations should be preserved:

1. **API Responses**: Standardize response format
2. **Database Queries**: Use indexing for optimization
3. **Documentation**: Add comments to complex functions

## Integration Architecture

The integration architecture between Canvas and Discourse should be preserved:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: For data synchronization
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Source of truth policies based on entity type
3. **Offline-First Capabilities**: Local storage, change tracking, sync queue

## Model Mapping

The model mapping between Canvas and Discourse should be preserved:

| Canvas | Discourse | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Course | Category | One-to-one mapping |
| Course Sections | Sub-categories | Optional |
| Discussion | Topic | One-to-one mapping |
| Discussion Entry | Post | One-to-one mapping |

## Next Steps

The following next steps were identified and should be preserved:

1. **API**: Add authentication to remaining endpoints
2. **Models**: Implement remaining Canvas models
3. **Testing**: Increase test coverage
4. **Documentation**: Improve documentation
