**Date**: 2025-04-09
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Project Team

## 1. Overview

This document defines the quality strategy for the Canvas-Discourse LMS integration project, establishing standards, practices, and targets to ensure high-quality deliverables.

## 2. Code Quality Standards

### Static Analysis

| Tool | Purpose | Configuration |
|------|---------|--------------|
| ESLint | JavaScript linting | `eslint:recommended`, `typescript:recommended` |
| Clippy | Rust linting | All warnings treated as errors |
| Prettier | Code formatting | Standard configuration with 2-space indent |
| rustfmt | Rust formatting | Standard configuration |

### Code Complexity Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | Max 15 per function/method |
| Nesting Depth | Max 4 levels |
| Method Length | Max 50 lines |
| File Length | Max 500 lines |
| Dependencies per Module | Max 10 |

### SOLID Principles

All code should adhere to SOLID principles:
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Classes/modules have one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **I**nterface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on unused methods
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## 3. Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Targets

| Component | Coverage Target |
|-----------|----------------|
| Models | 90% |
| Services | 85% |
| API Endpoints | 80% |
| UI Components | 70% |
| Overall | 80% |

### Test Types

| Test Type | Framework | Focus | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Unit Tests | Jest (JS), cargo test (Rust) | Individual functions and modules | Every PR |
| Integration Tests | Supertest, reqwest | API endpoints and service interactions | Every PR |
| UI Tests | Playwright | Component and page functionality | Every PR |
| E2E Tests | Playwright | Complete user flows | Daily |
| Performance Tests | k6 | API performance under load | Weekly |
| Security Tests | OWASP ZAP | Security vulnerabilities | Weekly |

### Test Environment

- Development: Local environment
- CI/CD: Containerized environment with mock dependencies
- Staging: Production-like environment with test data

## 4. Code Review Process

### Review Checklist

- Functionality: Code works as expected
- Code Quality: Adheres to standards and metrics
- Test Coverage: Includes adequate tests
- Documentation: Well-documented with comments and docs
- Security: No obvious security issues
- Performance: No obvious performance issues

### Review Process

1. Developer submits PR with description
2. Automated checks run (linting, tests, coverage)
3. At least one peer reviewer approves
4. Tech lead or architect reviews for architectural consistency
5. Changes merged to main branch

## 5. Dependency Management

### Selection Criteria

- Security: No known vulnerabilities
- Maintenance: Active development and support
- Licensing: Compatible with project licensing
- Performance: Minimal impact on performance
- Size: Minimal bundle size impact

### Dependency Updating

- Security patches: Immediate
- Minor updates: Monthly
- Major updates: Quarterly with impact analysis

## 6. Documentation Standards

- API Documentation: OpenAPI / Swagger
- Code Documentation: JSDoc / rustdoc
- Architecture Documentation: C4 model
- User Documentation: Markdown with screenshots

## 7. Continuous Integration

| Check | Tool | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Linting | ESLint, Clippy | Every PR |
| Formatting | Prettier, rustfmt | Every PR |
| Unit Tests | Jest, cargo test | Every PR |
| Integration Tests | Supertest, reqwest | Every PR |
| Coverage | Jest, cargo-tarpaulin | Every PR |
| Security Scan | npm audit, cargo audit | Daily |
| Bundle Analysis | webpack-bundle-analyzer | Every PR |

## 8. Quality Metrics Reporting

- Automated generation of quality reports
- Weekly quality metrics dashboard update
- Monthly quality review meetings
- Quarterly quality retrospective

This quality strategy will be reviewed and updated quarterly or as needed based on project evolution and feedback.
