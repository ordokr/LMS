# Documentation Requirements for Unified Analyzer

Based on the analysis of existing documentation in the LMS project and our relevance assessment, this document outlines the types of documentation the unified analyzer should generate.

## Documentation Priority Levels

We have categorized the documentation into high, medium, and low priority based on relevance:

### High Priority Documentation

These are the core documentation types that the unified analyzer should generate:

1. **Central Reference Hub** (`docs/central_reference_hub.md`)
2. **Architecture Documentation** (`docs/architecture/overview.md`)
3. **Models Documentation** (`docs/models/overview.md`)
4. **Integration Documentation** (`docs/integration/overview.md`)
5. **API Documentation** (`docs/api/reference.md`)
6. **Implementation Details** (`docs/implementation_details.md`)
7. **Testing Documentation** (`docs/tests.md`)
8. **Technical Debt Report** (`docs/technical_debt_report.md`)
9. **Summary Report** (`docs/SUMMARY_REPORT.md`)

### Medium Priority Documentation

These documentation types are important but secondary to the high priority ones:

1. **Synchronization Architecture** (`docs/synchronization_architecture.md`)
2. **Database Architecture** (`docs/database_architecture.md`)

### Documentation to Exclude

The following types of content should be excluded from the generated documentation:

1. AI/Gemini-related content
2. Temporary development notes
3. External reference documentation
4. Obsolete analyzer documentation that has been superseded by the unified analyzer

## High Priority Documentation Types

### 1. Central Reference Hub (`docs/central_reference_hub.md`)

This is the main entry point for all documentation. It should include:

- Project overview with status and completion percentage
- Technology stack details
- Architecture principles
- Design patterns
- Project statistics (file counts, lines of code, etc.)
- Integration status
- Code quality metrics
- Implementation tasks
- Links to other documentation

### 2. Architecture Documentation (`docs/architecture/overview.md`)

This document should provide an overview of the system architecture:

- Architecture principles
- Design patterns
- Component overview (organized by module/component)
- Integration architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Technology stack details

### 3. Models Documentation (`docs/models/overview.md`)

This document should provide information about data models:

- List of models with fields and file paths
- Models organized by source system (Canvas, Discourse, etc.)
- Data migration notes
- Model relationships

### 4. Integration Documentation (`docs/integration/overview.md`)

This document should provide information about the integration between Canvas and Discourse:

- Integration strategy
- Integration components with status
- Integration points
- Synchronization details

### 5. API Documentation (`docs/api/reference.md`)

This document should provide information about API endpoints:

- List of API endpoints organized by category
- Endpoint details (path, method, parameters, responses)
- Authentication requirements
- Example requests and responses

### 6. Implementation Details (`docs/implementation_details.md`)

This document should provide specific implementation information:

- Implementation status of various components
- Technical details of implementations
- Code examples

### 7. Testing Documentation (`docs/tests.md`)

This document should provide information about testing:

- Test coverage statistics
- List of tests by type
- Test results

### 8. Technical Debt Report (`docs/technical_debt_report.md`)

This document should provide information about technical debt:

- Areas with technical debt
- Recommendations for addressing technical debt
- Prioritization of technical debt items

### 9. Summary Report (`docs/SUMMARY_REPORT.md`)

This document should provide a high-level summary of the project status:

- Overall project status
- Key metrics
- Recent progress
- Next steps

## Medium Priority Documentation Types

### 1. Synchronization Architecture (`docs/synchronization_architecture.md`)

This document should provide information about the synchronization architecture:

- Synchronization strategy
- Synchronization components
- Conflict resolution
- Offline-first capabilities

### 2. Database Architecture (`docs/database_architecture.md`)

This document should provide information about the database architecture:

- Database schema
- Data migration
- Query optimization
- SQLite implementation details

## Documentation Format

All documentation should follow a consistent format:

1. **Title**: Clear title at the top
2. **Generation Information**: When the document was generated
3. **Overview**: Brief overview of the document's purpose
4. **Main Content**: Detailed information, organized in sections
5. **Tables**: Data presented in tables where appropriate
6. **Code Examples**: Code snippets where relevant
7. **Next Steps or Recommendations**: Suggestions for future work

## Documentation Structure

The documentation should be organized in the following directory structure:

```
docs/
├── central_reference_hub.md
├── architecture/
│   └── overview.md
├── models/
│   └── overview.md
├── integration/
│   └── overview.md
├── api/
│   └── reference.md
├── implementation_details.md
├── tests.md
├── technical_debt_report.md
├── SUMMARY_REPORT.md
├── synchronization_architecture.md
└── database_architecture.md
```

## Content Requirements

### Exclusions

As requested, any content related to AI/Gemini should be excluded from the documentation produced by the unified analyzer. Additionally, temporary development notes, external reference documentation, and obsolete analyzer documentation should be excluded.

### Inclusions

The documentation should include:

- Project structure information
- Technology stack details
- Architecture principles and patterns
- Data models and relationships
- API endpoints and details
- Integration points and strategies
- Implementation status and details
- Testing information
- Technical debt information
- Recommendations for next steps

## Automation

The unified analyzer should automatically generate all of these documentation types based on the analysis of the codebase. The documentation should be updated whenever the analyzer is run.
