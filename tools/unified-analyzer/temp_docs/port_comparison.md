# Source Code Port Comparison

*Generated on 2025-04-07*

This document compares the original Canvas and Discourse source code with our implementation.

## Canvas Models Comparison

## Discourse Models Comparison

## API Endpoints Comparison

## Findings and Recommendations

### Identified Issues

1. **Model Duplication**: Multiple definitions of core models exist in both source and target code
2. **API Path Conflicts**: Some API paths overlap between Canvas and Discourse endpoints
3. **Inconsistent Naming**: Different naming conventions are used across the codebase
4. **Authentication Mechanisms**: Different authentication approaches need to be unified

### Recommendations

1. **Consolidate Models**: Create unified model definitions that satisfy both systems' requirements
2. **Namespace APIs**: Use clear namespacing for API endpoints to prevent conflicts
3. **Standardize Naming**: Adopt consistent naming conventions as specified in the project guide
4. **Unified Auth**: Complete the JWT authentication implementation for both systems
