# Code Quality Analysis Report

# SOLID Principles Analysis

## Single Responsibility Principle Violations

A class should have only one reason to change.

Found **0** potential violations.


## Open-Closed Principle Violations

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Found **0** potential violations.


## Liskov Substitution Principle Violations

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Found **0** potential violations.


## Interface Segregation Principle Violations

Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

Found **0** potential violations.


## Dependency Inversion Principle Violations

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Found **0** potential violations.


# Design Patterns Analysis

## Polymorphism

The ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).

Found **0** implementations and **0** violations.


## Dependency Injection

A technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object.

Found **0** implementations and **0** violations.


## Inversion of Control (IoC)

A design principle in which control flow is inverted compared to traditional programming.

Found **0** implementations and **0** violations.
