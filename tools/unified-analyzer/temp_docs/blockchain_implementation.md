# Blockchain Implementation Technical Documentation

## Overview

The LMS blockchain implementation uses a hybrid consensus model combining Automerge CRDTs for local state and anchored verification through a SQLite backend. This approach provides:

- Offline-first operation with eventual consistency
- Fast local verification of academic achievements
- Memory-efficient transaction processing
- Prioritized sync capabilities for critical academic data

## Architecture Components

### Memory-Centric Architecture

Uses zero-copy deserialization for blockchain transactions and stack-allocated buffers for hot paths. Key performance optimizations include:
- `#[repr(C)]` for memory layout control
- Custom memory allocators for transaction processing
- Stack allocation for performance-critical paths

### Hybrid Consensus Protocol

Combines CRDT-based local consensus with anchored verification:
1. Local changes are immediately applied to Automerge CRDT
2. Changes are batched and anchored to SQLite based on priority
3. Online sync uses libp2p gossipsub for peer distribution
4. Offline changes use device graph BFT for eventual consensus

### Context-Aware Batching

Adaptively batches transactions based on:
- Transaction priority (Critical, High, Background)
- Current system load
- Network connectivity status
- Available memory resources

### Performance Metrics

The blockchain subsystem maintains comprehensive metrics:
- Transaction throughput (transactions/second)
- Block creation time (P50/P95/P99 latencies)
- Memory consumption
- Sync latency for network operations

## Integration Points

The blockchain system integrates with LMS components at these key points:
1. Achievement recording (grades, certificates, badges)
2. Forum post verification
3. Course progress tracking
4. Certificate verification
