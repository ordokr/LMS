# Documentation Relevance Analysis

This document analyzes the collected documentation files to determine which ones are most relevant for the unified analyzer to produce.

## Relevance Criteria

To determine relevance, we'll consider the following factors:

1. **Centrality**: Is the document a core part of the project documentation?
2. **Currency**: Does the document appear to be current and maintained?
3. **Comprehensiveness**: Does the document provide comprehensive information?
4. **Integration**: Is the document integrated with other documentation?
5. **Structure**: Does the document follow a consistent structure?
6. **Duplication**: Is the information duplicated in other documents?
7. **Temporary Nature**: Does the document appear to be for temporary development purposes?

## Conclusion

Based on this analysis, the unified analyzer should focus on producing the following types of documentation:

### High Priority (Core Documentation)
1. Central Reference Hub (`docs/central_reference_hub.md`)
2. Architecture Documentation (`docs/architecture/overview.md`)
3. Models Documentation (`docs/models/overview.md`)
4. Integration Documentation (`docs/integration/overview.md`)
5. API Documentation (`docs/api/reference.md`)
6. Implementation Details (`docs/implementation_details.md`)
7. Testing Documentation (`docs/tests.md`)
8. Technical Debt Report (`docs/technical_debt_report.md`)
9. Summary Report (`docs/SUMMARY_REPORT.md`)

### Medium Priority (Supporting Documentation)
1. Project Overview (`docs/project_overview.md`)
2. Synchronization Architecture (`docs/synchronization_architecture.md`)
3. Database Architecture (`docs/database_architecture.md`)

### Low Priority (Optional Documentation)
1. Migration Documentation (if migration is ongoing)
2. Performance Analysis (`docs/performance_analysis.md`)
3. Feature Coverage Map (`docs/feature_coverage_map.md`)

### Documentation to Exclude
1. AI/Gemini-related content
2. Temporary development notes
3. External reference documentation
4. Obsolete analyzer documentation that has been superseded by the unified analyzer
