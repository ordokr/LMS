2. Supporting files have been migrated to the unified_analyzer_extensions.rs file
3. The main.rs file has been updated to use the new methods
4. Obsolete files have been removed from src-tauri/src/analyzers

## Next Steps

- The original analyzers have been removed from the app
- The app main.rs file has been updated to remove references to the analyzers
