## Testing Strategy

The LMS project uses a comprehensive testing strategy that includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between multiple components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

### Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
cargo test test_name
```

## Next Steps

- Increase test coverage for models
- Add API tests
- Add UI tests
- Improve integration test coverage
