# Database Schema Visualization

This is a placeholder for the Database Schema visualization. The actual visualization has not been generated yet.

## Note

The visualization generator is currently not working properly. The visualization files are not being generated.

## How to Fix

Review and fix the visualization generator code in `src/generators/db_schema_generator.rs` and ensure that the generator function is properly called in `src/main.rs`.

Once fixed, you can generate the visualization by running:

```bash
cargo run --bin unified-analyzer -- --db-schema .
```

For more information, see the [Visualizations README](../README.md).
