This document serves as the central reference for the Ordo project.

## üéØ Project Vision

Ordo is a modular, offline-first Learning Management System (LMS) and Forum built with Rust, Tauri, and Leptos. It aims to provide a seamless educational experience even in environments with limited connectivity.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Ordo follows a client-server architecture with offline-first capabilities:

- **Frontend**: Leptos (Rust-based reactive framework)
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum/Actix Web
- **Desktop Wrapper**: Tauri
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLx ORM
- **Sync Engine**: Custom Rust implementation
