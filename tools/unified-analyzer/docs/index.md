## Project Overview

This documentation is generated from a comprehensive analysis of the Canvas and Discourse codebases. It provides insights into the structure, functionality, and implementation details of both systems, with the goal of recreating their functionality in a Rust/Tauri/Leptos environment with offline-first capabilities.

### Analysis Scope

- **File Structure**: Complete mapping of all source files and their relationships
- **Code Logic**: Full understanding of business logic implementation (backend + frontend)
- **API Flows**: Comprehensive API surface area and data flow mapping
- **Routing**: Complete route mapping and parameter handling
- **Template Rendering**: UI component structure and rendering logic
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Security model and permission system
- **Offline-First Readiness**: Data synchronization and offline capabilities
