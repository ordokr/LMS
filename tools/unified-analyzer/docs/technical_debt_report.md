# Technical Debt Report
_Generated on 2025-04-17_

## Overview

This report identifies areas of technical debt in the Ordo project and provides recommendations for addressing them.

## Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 0.0% | 80.0% |

## Technical Debt by Area

| Area | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Models | Medium | Some models lack proper documentation and validation. |
| API | High | Authentication is not implemented consistently across all endpoints. |
| UI Components | Low | Some components have hardcoded values that should be configurable. |
| Testing | High | Test coverage is low, especially for models and API endpoints. |
| Documentation | Medium | API documentation is incomplete. |
| Error Handling | Medium | Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase. |

## Specific Issues

| Issue | Priority | Description | File |
|-------|----------|-------------|------|
| Authentication | High | JWT token validation is not implemented in all API endpoints. | src/api/auth.rs |
| Models | Medium | Course model lacks proper validation for start and end dates. | src/models/course.rs |
| UI Components | Low | CourseList component has hardcoded pagination limit. | src/components/course_list.rs |
| Testing | High | No tests for user authentication flow. | src/api/auth.rs |
| Error Handling | Medium | Inconsistent error responses in API endpoints. | src/api/mod.rs |
| Documentation | Medium | Missing documentation for API error responses. | src/api/mod.rs |

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Implement Authentication Consistently**: Ensure all API endpoints validate JWT tokens properly.
2. **Increase Test Coverage**: Add tests for models and API endpoints, focusing on critical paths first.

### Medium Priority

1. **Improve Model Validation**: Add proper validation for all models, especially for date fields.
2. **Standardize Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling across all API endpoints.
3. **Complete API Documentation**: Document all API endpoints, including error responses.

### Low Priority

1. **Refactor UI Components**: Remove hardcoded values and make components more configurable.
2. **Improve Code Comments**: Add more detailed comments to complex code sections.
## Action Plan

1. Address high priority issues in the next sprint.
2. Allocate 20% of development time to addressing technical debt.
3. Set up automated code quality checks to prevent new technical debt.
4. Review technical debt report monthly and update priorities.
