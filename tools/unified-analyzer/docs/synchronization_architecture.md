# Canvas-Discourse Synchronization Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the synchronization architecture between Canvas LMS and Discourse forum systems, focusing on data consistency, performance, and reliability.

## Synchronization Status

- **Implementation Status**: in-progress
- **Offline Capability**: Yes

## Synchronization Priorities

Based on the blockchain capabilities outlined in our project guide, we've categorized synchronization priorities:

### Critical (Real-time sync)
- Grades
- Certificates
- Exam results

### High Priority (Near real-time, 5-15 min delay acceptable)
- Course completions
- Badges
- Assignment submissions

### Background (Batch processing, hourly/daily)
- Forum posts
- Profile updates
- Content edits

## Synchronization Architecture

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

The synchronization system uses an event-driven architecture to ensure data consistency between Canvas LMS and Discourse forums. Changes in either system generate events that are processed by the synchronization system.

### 2. Components

#### Event Producers
- Canvas Change Detector
- Discourse Change Detector
- Manual Sync Trigger

#### Message Queue
- RabbitMQ for message reliability
- Topic-based routing based on entity types
- Dead letter queue for failed synchronizations

#### Sync Processor
- Priority-based processing
- Transaction batching (as per blockchain requirements)
- Conflict resolution logic

#### Persistence Layer
- Transaction logs
- Sync state tracking
- Failure recovery data

### 3. Conflict Resolution

| Conflict Type | Resolution Strategy |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Data conflicts | Source of truth policies based on entity type |
| Timing conflicts | Timestamps + version vectors |
| Schema conflicts | Transformation mappings |

### 4. Monitoring & Recovery

- Sync health dashboard
- Failed transaction reporting
- Manual recovery tools
- Audit logging

## Offline-First Capabilities

The synchronization system is designed to work in offline environments:

1. **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally first
2. **Change Tracking**: Changes made offline are tracked
3. **Sync Queue**: Changes are queued for synchronization when online
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts are resolved when synchronizing

## Implementation Plan

1. Create event producer modules for Canvas and Discourse
2. Implement message queue infrastructure
3. Develop sync processor with priority handling
4. Build persistence layer for sync state
5. Create monitoring and recovery tools

## Next Steps

- Create detailed technical specifications for each component
- Implement prototype of event producers
- Set up message queue infrastructure
- Develop basic sync processor for testing
