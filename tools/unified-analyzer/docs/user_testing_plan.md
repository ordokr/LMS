# Unified Analyzer User Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for user testing of the enhanced generators in the Unified Analyzer. The goal is to gather feedback from users to identify issues, improve usability, and prioritize future enhancements.

## Testing Objectives

1. Evaluate the usability of the new generators (Migration Roadmap, Component Tree, API Map)
2. Identify any bugs or issues in the generators
3. Gather feedback on the visualization quality and usefulness
4. Assess the documentation clarity and completeness
5. Determine if the generators meet the users' needs for analyzing Discourse and Canvas codebases

## Test Participants

We aim to recruit 5-8 participants with the following profiles:
- Developers familiar with Discourse and/or Canvas
- Developers with experience in Rust, Tauri, or Leptos
- Project managers involved in migration planning
- Technical writers or documentation specialists

## Testing Environment

- Participants will use their own development environments
- The Unified Analyzer will be deployed to their machines
- Test data will include sample Discourse and Canvas codebases

## Testing Tasks

Participants will be asked to complete the following tasks:

### Task 1: Installation and Setup
1. Install the Unified Analyzer using the deployment script
2. Verify that the installation was successful
3. Review the documentation to understand the available generators

### Task 2: Running Basic Analysis
1. Run a quick analysis on the provided sample codebase
2. Examine the unified output JSON file
3. Note any issues or observations

### Task 3: Generating Visualizations
1. Generate a migration roadmap
2. Generate a component tree visualization
3. Generate an API map
4. Generate all visualizations at once
5. Examine each visualization and note any issues or observations

### Task 4: Using the Visualizations
1. Use the migration roadmap to identify the phases of migration
2. Use the component tree to understand the component hierarchy
3. Use the API map to explore the API endpoints
4. Note any usability issues or suggestions for improvement

### Task 5: Documentation Review
1. Review the documentation for each generator
2. Identify any missing or unclear information
3. Suggest improvements to the documentation

## Feedback Collection

We will collect feedback through:

1. **Feedback Form**: A structured form to capture specific feedback on each generator
2. **Observation Notes**: Notes taken by the test facilitator during the testing session
3. **Post-Test Interview**: A brief interview to gather additional insights

## Timeline

1. **Preparation Phase** (1 week)
   - Finalize test plan
   - Prepare test environment and data
   - Recruit participants

2. **Testing Phase** (2 weeks)
   - Conduct user testing sessions
   - Collect feedback

3. **Analysis Phase** (1 week)
   - Analyze feedback
   - Identify common issues and suggestions
   - Prioritize improvements

4. **Implementation Phase** (2-4 weeks)
   - Implement high-priority improvements
   - Update documentation
   - Prepare for next round of testing

## Success Criteria

The user testing will be considered successful if:
1. We collect feedback from at least 5 participants
2. We identify at least 3 actionable improvements for each generator
3. We gain insights into the overall usability of the Unified Analyzer
4. We have a clear prioritization of future enhancements

## Feedback Analysis Template

We will use the following template to analyze the feedback:

```

```

## Conclusion

This user testing plan provides a structured approach to gathering feedback on the enhanced generators in the Unified Analyzer. By following this plan, we can identify issues, improve usability, and prioritize future enhancements based on user needs.
