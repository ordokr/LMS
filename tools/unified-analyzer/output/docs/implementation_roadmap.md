# Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the proposed roadmap for implementing the offline-first Rust/Tauri/Leptos version of Canvas and Discourse functionality.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

### Goals

- Set up the basic project architecture
- Implement core data models
- Create the local database schema
- Build the basic UI shell

### Tasks

1. Set up Tauri project with Leptos integration
2. Define core domain models in Rust
3. Set up SQLite database with Diesel ORM
4. Implement basic UI navigation shell
5. Create authentication system
6. Implement basic user profile functionality

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (Months 4-6)

### Goals

- Implement core LMS features
- Build basic forum functionality
- Create the sync engine foundation

### Tasks

1. Implement course creation and management
2. Build assignment submission system
3. Create basic forum with topics and posts
4. Implement file upload/download with local storage
5. Build the basic sync engine for data synchronization
6. Implement offline queue for operations while disconnected

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 7-9)

### Goals

- Implement advanced LMS features
- Enhance forum capabilities
- Improve sync engine with conflict resolution

### Tasks

1. Implement grading and feedback system
2. Build quiz and assessment functionality
3. Add forum moderation tools
4. Implement advanced forum features (categories, tags, etc.)
5. Enhance sync engine with conflict resolution strategies
6. Implement data compression for efficient sync

## Phase 4: Polish and Optimization (Months 10-12)

### Goals

- Optimize performance
- Enhance user experience
- Prepare for production release

### Tasks

1. Performance optimization for large datasets
2. Implement advanced caching strategies
3. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Implement analytics and telemetry (opt-in)
6. Prepare deployment and distribution pipeline

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the analysis of the Canvas and Discourse codebases, the following features should be prioritized for implementation:

### High Priority

1. User authentication and profiles
2. Course management
3. Basic forum functionality
4. Offline data synchronization
5. File management with local storage

### Medium Priority

1. Assignment submission and grading
2. Advanced forum features
3. Notifications system
4. Search functionality
5. Calendar and scheduling

### Lower Priority

1. Analytics and reporting
2. Integration with external tools
3. Advanced quiz features
4. Video conferencing
5. Mobile-specific optimizations

## Technical Challenges

The following technical challenges have been identified and will need special attention:

1. **Conflict Resolution**: Handling conflicts when syncing data modified both locally and remotely
2. **Large File Handling**: Efficiently managing large files in an offline-first context
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Implementing collaborative features that work offline
4. **Performance**: Ensuring good performance with potentially large local databases
5. **Security**: Maintaining proper security in a distributed system
