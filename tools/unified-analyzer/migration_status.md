## Integration Status

We have successfully integrated the functionality from all the original analyzers into the unified analyzer:

2. Supporting files have been migrated to the unified_analyzer_extensions.rs file
3. The main.rs file has been updated to use the new methods

## Next Steps

1. Run the unified analyzer to verify that it works correctly
2. Remove the obsolete files using the cleanup_project_analyzer.ps1 script
3. Update the documentation to reflect the new structure
4. Test the project analyzer functionality using the test_project_analyzer binary

## Migration Notes

- The unified analyzer can be run from its own directory nested within the LMS folder
- The analyzers have been consolidated into one unified analyzer with modular parts
- The original analyzers have been removed from the app
- The app main.rs file has been updated to remove references to the analyzers
