- Migration completed: TBD (will be calculated by analyzer)
- Migration not started: TBD (will be calculated by analyzer) 
- Migration in progress: TBD (will be calculated by analyzer)
- Migration not needed: TBD (will be calculated by analyzer)

## In Progress Migrations

## Not Started Migrations

These files will be automatically detected and prioritized by the analyzer.

## Rules for JavaScript to Rust Migration

1. Prioritize core services and APIs first
2. Focus on data models next
3. Move utilities to Rust
4. Migrate controllers and routes to Rust commands
5. Tests should be migrated last

## Migration Guidelines

- Use appropriate Rust idioms rather than direct translation
- Take advantage of Rust's type system
- Consider using async/await for asynchronous operations
- Follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for variables and functions)
- Document all public interfaces with doc comments
