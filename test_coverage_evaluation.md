## Critical Paths Requiring Additional Tests

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Token refresh mechanisms
   - Permission checking
   - Session management

2. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Network error recovery
   - Database error handling
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Conflict resolution
   - Partial sync recovery
   - Offline-to-online transitions

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Constraint enforcement
   - Transaction management
   - Referential integrity

5. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Throttling behavior
   - Backoff strategies
   - Queue management

## Expected Behaviors After Refactoring

### API Client Behavior

1. **Authentication**
   - Clients should authenticate using the appropriate method for each API
   - Tokens should be refreshed automatically when expired
   - Authentication failures should be handled gracefully

2. **Error Handling**
   - Network errors should be retried with exponential backoff
   - API errors should be mapped to appropriate application errors
   - Rate limiting should be respected with appropriate waiting

3. **Data Operations**
   - All CRUD operations should work as before
   - Pagination should be handled transparently
   - Large responses should be streamed efficiently

### Repository Behavior

1. **CRUD Operations**
   - All entities should support consistent CRUD operations
   - Transactions should be used appropriately
   - Constraints should be enforced consistently

2. **Query Operations**
   - Complex queries should return the same results
   - Performance should be maintained or improved
   - Pagination should work consistently

3. **Error Handling**
   - Database errors should be mapped to appropriate application errors
   - Constraint violations should be handled gracefully
   - Connection issues should be retried appropriately

### Error Handling Behavior

1. **Error Creation**
   - Errors should be created with appropriate context
   - Error types should be consistent across the application
   - Error messages should be helpful and actionable

2. **Error Propagation**
   - Errors should be propagated up the call stack
   - Low-level errors should be wrapped in appropriate application errors
   - Context should be added at each level

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Recoverable errors should be handled automatically when possible
   - Unrecoverable errors should be reported clearly
   - Users should be given appropriate guidance for resolution

### Synchronization Behavior

1. **Bidirectional Sync**
   - Changes should be synchronized in both directions
   - Conflicts should be detected and resolved according to policy
   - Partial syncs should be resumable

2. **Incremental Sync**
   - Only changed data should be synchronized
   - Performance should be better than full sync
   - Consistency should be maintained

3. **Sync Management**
   - Sync status should be tracked accurately
   - Errors should be reported and recoverable
   - Progress should be reported to the user

## Test Implementation Plan

1. **Create Base Test Suites**
   - Implement base test suites for each component type
   - Include tests for common functionality
   - Ensure test coverage for critical paths

2. **Add Component-Specific Tests**
   - Extend base test suites with component-specific tests
   - Cover unique functionality and edge cases
   - Test integration with other components

3. **Implement Integration Tests**
   - Create integration tests for component interactions
   - Test end-to-end workflows
   - Verify system behavior as a whole

4. **Add Performance Tests**
   - Implement performance tests for critical operations
   - Establish performance baselines
   - Verify performance after refactoring

5. **Create Regression Tests**
   - Implement tests for known issues
   - Ensure issues don't recur after refactoring
   - Add tests for new issues as they're discovered
